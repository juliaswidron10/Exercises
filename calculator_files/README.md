# Word's worst calculator

School project for the word's worst calculator where the user can use very poorly designed and working calculator
my code has three functions

1. first function to handle the calculation, after pressing calculate my program reads values
   of the imput forms and which operator the user wants to use. the function returns value of the calculation
2. second function is to display the result in the DOM, based on the information from checkbox the program reads if
   it should round number or leave the result as it is and pass it to the list element.
3. Last function "clear" reloads the page to get fresh calculator without any input fields filled out.
